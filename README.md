**Team Details** :-

Shashwat Rai(Leader), Shivam Kundra, Sakshi Rai, Prapti Sharma

**Problem Statement** :-

Lightening strokes cause major life loss. Government of India has the sufficient 
Resources to detect these pre-hand but dissemination of the information at the 
wise moment and within time has always been a subject to conquer. 
Rural people being most susceptible to perilous circumstances are our 
Principal object.

**Solution** :-

'LIFE LOSS DUE TO DEADLY LIGHTNING STROKES'

Information about the lightning strokes is available with 'The Indian Meteorological Department' which has real time data that includes the details about lightning strokes 4 hours and 30 minutes prior.

We focus on disseminating the information within the required time. The people who live in remote areas are our main target as they are least exposed to early access of broadbanded information. This life saving 'Early Warning System' will be able to disseminate information about lightning directly to village.

In the targeted situation , registered users will also get Bulk SMS , notifications and mails will be sent to nearest evacuation bodies and gram panchayats of villages. Non- registered rural inhabitants will get SMS.


User is provided with a secure login, server collects weather data from renowed APIs of IMD. We also handle cases of remote areas using 'high pitch sound' through mobile speakers. In case of panic, SOS call making is provided.


The evolution that we have carried out in the Early warning sytem doesn't only help in saving lives and reduces property damage but also helps in gaining new weather datasets to optimize operations, analyze trends and protect infrastructural assests.
